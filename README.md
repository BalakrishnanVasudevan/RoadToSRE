# RoadToSRE
Documenting my journey as I attempt to crack the Google SRE interview. This will be my third attempt and I hope to clear it this time.

**Previous Attempts:** 

In my first attempt, I went through two coding phone screens. I was asked to write a system function using Python and in my second interview, I was asked to explain memory management in Python. I was told that Google was looking for more "depth" from the candidates. I feel that although I was able to answer the coding question, my solution was not memory efficient and I did not know better memory management techniques. Things to improve for this time.

**Areas to work on:**

1) Programming using Python
2) Linux Internals
3) Linux Troubleshooting
4) Non-abstract Large Scale Systems Design
5) Networks
